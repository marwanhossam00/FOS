# FOS - Functions for OS

Welcome to **FOS**, a project dedicated to building essential functions for an operating system. This project focuses on creating utility functions that help with operating system-level operations, aiming to offer a lightweight and efficient solution for OS-related tasks.

## Features

- **System Utilities**: Functions for interacting with OS-level features such as file management, process control, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- A C programming language
- Makefile (or any build system you prefer)
- how to treat with eclips
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Reda-Mohamed-201/FOS_PROJECT_2024_TEMPLATE.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd FOS
    ```


### Usage

Once the project is compiled, you can run the functions directly from the command line. For example:

```bash
./fos_function_name

# Operating System Core Components Implementation
This project involved the design and implementation of core operating system components, focusing on memory management, synchronization mechanisms, and process scheduling. The goal was to build a robust and efficient OS foundation with advanced features to enhance system performance and reliability.

# Key Features Implemented
## Memory Management
- Dynamic Allocators: Designed and implemented dynamic memory allocators to efficiently manage system memory.

- Fast Page Allocation: Developed a fast page allocation mechanism to optimize memory usage and reduce latency.

- Page Fault Handling: Engineered efficient page fault handling to ensure smooth execution of processes and minimize downtime.

## Synchronization Mechanisms
- Spinlocks and Semaphores: Implemented synchronization primitives such as spinlocks and semaphores to ensure thread safety and prevent race conditions.

- Priority-Based Round Robin Scheduler: Optimized process scheduling using a priority-based Round Robin algorithm, improving system responsiveness and fairness.

## Advanced Features
- Shared Memory: Implemented shared memory mechanisms to enable efficient inter-process communication (IPC).

- User Heaps: Developed user heap management to support dynamic memory allocation for user-level applications.

- Nth Chance Clock Page Replacement: Engineered the Nth Chance Clock page replacement algorithm to enhance memory management and reduce page faults.
